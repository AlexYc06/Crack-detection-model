# Crack detection model using U-net

It's a course project of a freshman who majors in Civil Engineering, focuses on crack detection and convolutional network. 

The project references code from ***Computer vision-based concrete crack detection using U-net fully
convolutional networks (Liu et al.)*** and dataset from ***DeepCrack: A deep hierarchical feature learning architecture for crack segmentation (Liu et al.)***. I have modified some parameters and code on their basis, with the help of DeepSeek. 

This project have achieved: 

- Making a crack detection model with relatively high accuracy
- Comparing U-net with CNN
- Choosing the best loss function and optimizer
